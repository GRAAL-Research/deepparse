class ParsedAddress:
    """
    A parsed address as commonly known returned by an address parser.

    Note:
        Since an address component can be composed of multiple elements (e.g. Wolfe street), when the probability
        values are asked of the address parser, the address components don't keep it. It's only available through the
        ``address_parsed_components`` attribute.

    Attributes:
        raw_address: The raw address (not parsed).
        address_parsed_components: The parsed address in a list of tuples where the first elements
            are the address components and the second elements are the tags.
        street_number: The street number.
        unit: The street unit component.
        street_name: The street name.
        orientation: The street orientation.
        municipality: The city.
        province: The province (sometime known as district or local region).
        postal_code: The street postal code.
        general_delivery: Additional delivery information.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

                address_parser = AddressParser()
                parse_address = address_parser("350 rue des Lilas Ouest Quebec city Quebec G1L 1B6")
                print(parse_address.street_number) #350
                print(parse_address.postal_code) # G1L 1B6

            the first elements are address components, and the second elements are the parsed address
            value. Also, the second tuple's address value can either be the tag of the components
            (e.g. StreetName) or a tuple (``x``, ``y``) where ``x`` is the tag and ``y`` is the
            probability (e.g. 0.9981) of the model prediction.
