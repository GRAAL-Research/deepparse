## 0.2.1

- Fixed README

## 0.2.2

- Fixed error with experiment and verbosity as logging trigger on or off

## 0.2.3

- Improved documentation

## 0.3

- Added Libpostal time in the doc
- Documentation improvement
- Added new models evaluation to doc
- Release new models

## 0.3.3

- We have improved the loading of data during prediction. We now use a data loader.
- Updated the performance table of models with the data loader approach.
- Fixed missing import in the parser module.
- Bug fix of the `max_len` for the predictions

## 0.3.4

- Fixed a bug when using batched address. Since we were sorting the address during the forward pass, the output
  prediction tags were not aligned with the supposed parsed address. We have removed the sorting, and now the results
  are more aligned with our research.

## 0.3.5

- Added verbose flag to training and test based on the __init__ of address parser.
- **Breaking change** Since [SciPy 1.6](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/releases/tag/v1.6.0) is released on Python `3.7+`
  , we don't support Python `3.6`.
- Added management for Windows where the FastText model cannot be pickled. On Windows, we use Gensim fasttext model,
  which takes more RAM.

## 0.3.6

- Added a method for a dict conversion of parsed addresses for simpler `Pandas` integration.
- Added examples for parsing addresses and how to convert them into a DataFrame.
- Fixed error with download module.

## 0.4

- Added verbose flag to training and test based on the __init__ of address parser.
- Added a feature to retrain our models with prediction tags dictionary different from the default one.
- Added in-doc code examples.
- Added code examples.
- Small improvement of models implementation.

## 0.4.1

- Added method to specify the format of address components of an `FormattedParsedAddress`. Formatting can specify the
  field separator, the field to be capitalized, and the field to be upper case.

## 0.4.2

- Added `__eq__` method to `FormattedParsedAddress`.
- Improved device management.
- Improved testing.

## 0.4.3

- Fixed typos in one of a file name.
- Added tools to compare addresses (tagged or not).
- Fixed some tests errors.

## 0.4.4

- Fixed import error.

## 0.5

- Added Python 3.9
- Added feature to allow a more flexible way to retrain
- Added a feature to allow retraining of a new seq2seq architecture
- Fixed prediction tags bug when parsing with new tags after retraining

## 0.5.1

- Fixed address_comparer hint typing error
- Fixed some docs errors
- Retrain and test now have more defaults parameters
- Various small code and tests improvements

## 0.6

- Added Attention mechanism models
- Fixed EOS bug

## 0.6.1

- Completed EOS bug fix

## 0.6.2

- Improved (slightly) code speed of data padding method as per PyTorch list or array to Tensor recommendation.
- Improved doc for RuntimeError due to retraining FastText and BPEmb model in the same directory.
- Added error handling RuntimeError when retraining.

## 0.6.3

- Fixed the printing capture to raise the error with Poutyne as of version 1.8. We keep the previous approach as for
  compatibilities with the previous Poutyne version.
- Added a flag to disable or not Tensorboard during retraining.

## 0.6.4

- Bugfix reloading of retrain attention model (PR #110)
- Improve error handling
- Improve doc

- Parsing now include two validation on the data quality (not empty and not whitespace only)
- DataContainer now includes data quality test (not empty, not whitespace only, tags not empty, tag the same len as an
  address and data is a list of tuple)
- New CSVDatasetContainer
- DataContainer can now be used to predict using a flag.
- Add a CLI to parse addresses from the command line.
